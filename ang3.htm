 The first stage of project realisation would be devoted to detailed design 
of
 detectors and the basic software for the station.
 In parallel, a series of lectures in high schools will be organized to 
introduce students
 and teachers into the area of high energy physics, astrophysics and cosmic 
ray physics,
 and also to demonstrate assumptions and capabilities of the Maze project. 
In course
 of works on prototype stations and software the seminars 
 devoted to particular solutions would be organized for teachers and 
students.
<br>
 In the initial phase 2-4 prototype stations would be built and
successively   started. After several months of work (counting also 
necessary
tests)  the system should be sufficient to confirm the realised concept by
showing   physical registrations of very high energy showers, and correct 
and
stable  work of the whole system.<br>

<br>
 In the proposed version of the Maze project the detection stations 
 would be separated by distance from half to two kilometers. Larger
 separation would cause that a station would never (?) in practice
 register an event in coincidence with any other, so it could realise
 only self-sufficient tasks, severely narrowing the sense of the whole
 enterprise.
However, it is possible to formulate a serious research problem (from
 cosmic ray physics area) also for distant detection points.
 Quite recently reports about simultaneous registrations of extensive
 air showers in arrays separated by even hundreds of kilometers have 
appeared
 in the world literature. The idea explaining such phenomenon has 
been put
 forward by Gerasimova and Zatsepin already a long time ago. It assumes
that  the showers have been initiated by the fragments of atomic nucleus
 produced far above the Earth atmosphere, which managed to separate   
 by such a great distance. Experimental studies are being carried actually
 to deny or confirm earlier reports. <br>

 It is evident that there are no principal obstacles to enlarge the 
activity
 in the frame of the Maze project outside the borders of Lodz and organize
 constructing of the detection nets (a few interested schools in one town 
would be
 sufficient) at big distances and analysing the data gathered by them 
 from specific point of view. 
Every, not very small town is able (depending on
 resources and capabilities) to join the project. 
<br>
Borders of our country are
 certainly not the borders for physics, and especially for cosmic ray 
physics.
 We may expect that similar projects will start also in other countries,
 for sure at first in US. The exchange of information, concepts, results 
 and achievements via WWW  would be undoubtedly valuable. It is not 
excluded,
 that the global network for observation of Gerasimova-Zatsepin effect
 could bring very interesting physical results.
