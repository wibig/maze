 The problem of finding young people who could eventually decide to devote
 themselves to science, and to physics in particular, is not a specific 
Polish
 problem, although it can relate to us in greater extent than to societies 
 a bit more technologically developed. In whole Europe the diminishing
interest  in physics and in studying physics can be observed. The reasons 
are
plural  and this is not a place for analysing them.
<br> 
 It seems that introducing teachers of physics and students to the 
realisation
 of the project being in itself the physical project <i> sensu stricte</i>
(and even more,  making them direct performers of such a project), with 
the
use of newest technologies,  not only may, but for sure will cause an 
increase
of interest, about which we wrote  above.
<br>
 Contact with centres where physics is done every day may reveal to the
young people  quite unknown for them possible ways of arranging their own
future.  The work in group on tests in the phase of starting the array, 
and
then on   analysing "their own" data, constructing "their own" software,
presenting  results on "their own" WWW pages, will give those young people
fantastic   possibility to show themselves off intellectually and
simultaneously to adjust  themselves to the work in a team. 
<br>
 The detection system of a station allows to conduct quite independent
 observations and studies for each group participating in the project.
 One can study for example:
<ul><li>

   de-coherence curve (i.e. to repeat the historical experiment of Maze)

</li>
<br><li>
 temperature effect

</li>
<br><li>
   barometric effect

</li>
<br><li>
  angular distributions (zenithal and azimuthal)
     in order to find effective
      acceptance of the station array

</li>
<br><li>
   anisotropy in celestial coordinates (and also Galactic coordinates)

</li>
<br><li>
   shape of energy spectrum around 10<sup><font size=+1>15</font></sup>eV

</li>
<br><li>
   correlations with activity of the Sun, the state of atmosphere, etc.
</li></ul>
<br>
 There are quite a few possibilities and the field for showing off for
everybody  is huge. Permanent contact ("on demand") with researchers 
should
additionally  broaden these possibilities.
<br>
 In course of project development, beside communication via Internet, it 
seems
 important to organize gatherings and meetings of its participants: 
students,
 teachers and researchers. During such meetings, apart from the obvious
exchange   of information, sessions (seminars) should be organized, at 
which
schools would   present their achievements. The sessions could be 
accompanied
by the lectures  on physical topics more or less closely related to the 
Maze
project.  
 Because during the last International Cosmic Ray Conferences projects of
 similar systems have been presented in the form of short communications,
 it is very important to present also the Maze project to the society of
physicists  in a similar way at the next Conference, as soon as the 
project
enters the stage  of realisation. The results of works conducted in the 
frame
of the Maze   project after sufficiently long period of data acquisition 
would
for sure  fulfill the criteria demanded from scientific works published in
refereed  professional literature.
