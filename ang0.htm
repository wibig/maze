 <B>Roland Maze</B></font><font size=+1>
 was a co-discoverer of Extensive Air Showers of cosmic rays.
 The array built by him on the roof of Ecole Normale Superieure
 in Paris enabled the observation of simultaneous registrations of high
 energy particles in two detectors separated by ~30 m. 
 His name has been placed together with the name of Pierre Auger in the 
headers
 of the <a href="am1.ps">first papers of 1938</a>  reporting about the discovery.
<br>

 At the beginning of the fifties, when the cosmic ray laboratory in Lodz
 was being formed, Roland Maze closely collaborated with Polish
 physicists. It is not easy to estimate nowadays his role in creation
 of the Lodz group and its first scientific achievements. He was together 
 with Aleksander Zawadzki, Juliusz Hibner, Jerzy Gawin
 and Jerzy Wdowczyk (among others) the co-author of many papers, which 
established
 the position of Lodz among distinguished centres of high energy physics in 
the world.<br>

 Comparing the scale and goals of presented further project with those
 of the international and over 100 mln $ Auger Project, it seems justified 
 to call our enterprise with the name of Roland Maze, as a tribute to  
 this great scientist.<br></font></td>

<center><font size=+2><b>Physical background</b></font></center><font size=+1><br>
The phenomenon of cosmic radiation is known for 90 years. It was discovered (as
a <I>Hoehenstrahlung</i>) by Viktor Hess and now we knew that
the Earth is constantly bombarded by the high energy particles coming from the
outer space. Cosmic ray studies are recently intensively developed, especially
 in the region of the upper limit of energy spectrum (see Figure beside), where 
 several single cases of particles with energies exceeding 10<sup>20</sup>eV
 (~50 J) have been observed. Such energies are 100 mln times 
 higher than those which can be studied in laboratory experiments
 and most probably higher than those that can ever be achieved in
 experiments built by human hand. Apart from the obvious, but extremely
 compound problem what is going on with matter during collisions
 with such enormous energy release, the question what astrophysical
 mechanisms are at all able to produce particles with such energies
 is also very intriguing.
 If we add to this that the nature of these particles
 is also unknown (they can be protons, compound atomic nuclei, gamma 
quanta,
 neutrinos or even yet undiscovered new particles predicted by theories
 beyond the so called Standard Model), it can not be surprising, that 
 to find answers to at least some of these questions
 just now large ground level arrays are being built (<A
HREF="http://www.auger.org">Auger Observatory</a>)
 and quantitatively completely new satellite experiments
 (<A HREF="http://owl.gsfc.nasa.gov/intro.html">OWL</a>,

<center><font size=+2><b>Important technical problems</b></font></center><font size=+1><br>
 The main difficulty is due to the fact that the flux of particles
 with energies above 10<sup>20</sup>eV is of the order of 1 particle per square 
km
 per century (or even lower), so the detector area has to be sufficiently
 large to obtain required result in reasonable time. The biggest actually 
working 
 experiment <A Href="http://www-akeno.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/AGASA">AGASA</a>
 consists of particle counters spread over an area of 
100km<sup>2</sup>.
 During ~20 years of work it has registered 17 such events 
(as has been claimed at the last cosmic ray conference in Hamburg in 
August this year,
but there are opinions that this number can be overestimated).
 In the projected Auger experiment 1600 detectors will be spread over 10 
times
 bigger area. The main goal of such experiments is to determine (or rather 
estimate)
 in each registered event the energy of the particle which has initiated in 
the
 atmosphere a phenomenon called an extensive air shower, i.e. the cascade 
of
 particles (mainly photons, electrons and muons) with lateral size at the
 observation level measured in kilometers. Such estimation is performed 
basing
 on measurement of particle density in a shower in a few points separated
 by several hundreds meters (1.5 km in the Auger experiment). Moreover, 
measuring
 the times of shower arrival to different detection points one can 
determine
 the direction on the celestial sphere from which the primary particle has 
come.  <br>

 The single detector is essentially a very simple device. It usually 
consists of
 a few scintillation (or Cherenkov) counters connected to the electronic 
system
 with a simple coincidence trigger and converters of time and amplitude of 
signals to 
 digital codes. The essence of large area experiments is a method of 
synchronization
 and communication between detectors and a system of collecting and storing 
the data.
This can be performed by normal optical fibers, like in the AGASA 
experiment,
or by radio, like in the Yakutsk array or in the Auger experiment. 

A non-trivial
problem is also maintaining  stable and reliable performance of the system
(service) and  providing power supply to the detectors separated in total 
by
tens of kilometers.

    <center><font size=+2><b>Concept of the Maze project</b></font></center> <br>
<font size=+1> In the proposed experiment detection points would be placed in the 
buildings
 (or better on the roofs) 
of Lodz high schools. Their net is dense enough (see Figure beside)
 to enable observation of particles starting from energies of 10<sup>18</sup>eV,
 for which expected frequency of interesting registrations is much greater
 (several thousands times) than for cases from the narrow region above
 10<sup>20</sup>eV. So one can expect first interesting experimental results 
already
 in the preliminary stage of realisation of the project with a small number
 of detection points. While the large experiments are dedicated exclusively 
 to big science, in our project each station (school) would constitute 
autonomous
 air shower array. Small, but developed enough to provide results which 
could
 themselves serve as material to interesting studies related to cosmic ray 
 physics and to independent developing of data analysis methods.<br>


For available spacing between detectors in a station (of the order of 
~10 m) 
 the chance of observing highest energy showers in one separate station is 
very small,
 but a special trigger system may provide full efficiency of registration 
of showers
 with energies ~ 10<sup>15</sup>eV falling on the detection area 
(100 m<sup>2</sup>).
 For a specific realisation (discrimination levels) one can obtain sensible 
 frequency of events counted in 1 min<sup>-1</sup>.<br>

 To enable independent observations in a separate station (high school) 
each 
 of them should be equipped with 4 scintillation counters of area
 ~ 1 m<sup>2</sup>.
 The electronic system should enable measurement of relative times with 
accuracy
 of ~ 5 ns (that would give angular resolution of ~ 5<sup>o</sup>) and
 measurement of 
signal amplitudes from all the detectors.
<br>
The system of converters and
master elaboration  would be connected to a PC-class computer, on which
preliminary data analysis  and storing would be performed. The scheme of a
single detection station is shown  in the figure.
<br>
 
To enable coordination of work of all the stations, which is the essence of 
described
 project, the GPS system seems at the moment the best for time 
synchronization.
 In the standard version GPS provides absolute time with sufficient 
accuracy
 (~300 ns) to synchronize events in different station. It seems
reasonable  to increase accuracy to several nanoseconds 
to enable additional
determination of particle direction in cases of  simultaneous registrations 
in
several stations, that are expected for the highest  energy showers, 
studies
of which are the main scientific goal of this project.<br>

 Communication between stations  
would be realised via Internet (see the figure to the right).
 Permanent connection to the net is not demanded, as the data stored in
 computer memory can be only once per some time sent to the central server.
 The server would put the data in some order, store and archivise them,
 and make accessible for each group on demand.
 In this way each group taking part in the realisation of the project would 
be
 able to independently analyse the whole gathered data and perform its own 
original
 studies.

<font size=+1>
<br>

 The first stage of project realisation would be devoted to detailed design 
of
 detectors and the basic software for the station.
 In parallel, a series of lectures in high schools will be organized to 
introduce students
 and teachers into the area of high energy physics, astrophysics and cosmic 
ray physics,
 and also to demonstrate assumptions and capabilities of the Maze project. 
In course
 of works on prototype stations and software the seminars 
 devoted to particular solutions would be organized for teachers and 
students.
<br>
 In the initial phase 2-4 prototype stations would be built and
successively   started. After several months of work (counting also 
necessary
tests)  the system should be sufficient to confirm the realised concept by
showing   physical registrations of very high energy showers, and correct 
and
stable  work of the whole system.<br>

<br>
 In the proposed version of the Maze project the detection stations 
 would be separated by distance from half to two kilometers. Larger
 separation would cause that a station would never (?) in practice
 register an event in coincidence with any other, so it could realise
 only self-sufficient tasks, severely narrowing the sense of the whole
 enterprise.
However, it is possible to formulate a serious research problem (from
 cosmic ray physics area) also for distant detection points.
 Quite recently reports about simultaneous registrations of extensive
 air showers in arrays separated by even hundreds of kilometers have 
appeared
 in the world literature. The idea explaining such phenomenon has 
been put
 forward by Gerasimova and Zatsepin already a long time ago. It assumes
that  the showers have been initiated by the fragments of atomic nucleus
 produced far above the Earth atmosphere, which managed to separate   
 by such a great distance. Experimental studies are being carried actually
 to deny or confirm earlier reports. <br>

 It is evident that there are no principal obstacles to enlarge the 
activity
 in the frame of the Maze project outside the borders of Lodz and organize
 constructing of the detection nets (a few interested schools in one town 
would be
 sufficient) at big distances and analysing the data gathered by them 
 from specific point of view. 
Every, not very small town is able (depending on
 resources and capabilities) to join the project. 
<br>
Borders of our country are
 certainly not the borders for physics, and especially for cosmic ray 
physics.
 We may expect that similar projects will start also in other countries,
 for sure at first in US. The exchange of information, concepts, results 
 and achievements via WWW  would be undoubtedly valuable. It is not 
excluded,
 that the global network for observation of Gerasimova-Zatsepin effect
 could bring very interesting physical results.</font>

<font size=+1>
<br>


 The problem of finding young people who could eventually decide to devote
 themselves to science, and to physics in particular, is not a specific 
Polish
 problem, although it can relate to us in greater extent than to societies 
 a bit more technologically developed. In whole Europe the diminishing
interest  in physics and in studying physics can be observed. The reasons 
are
plural  and this is not a place for analysing them.
<br> 
 It seems that introducing teachers of physics and students to the 
realisation
 of the project being in itself the physical project <i> sensu stricte</i>
(and even more,  making them direct performers of such a project), with 
the
use of newest technologies,  not only may, but for sure will cause an 
increase
of interest, about which we wrote  above.
<br>
 Contact with centres where physics is done every day may reveal to the
young people  quite unknown for them possible ways of arranging their own
future.  The work in group on tests in the phase of starting the array, 
and
then on   analysing "their own" data, constructing "their own" software,
presenting  results on "their own" WWW pages, will give those young people
fantastic   possibility to show themselves off intellectually and
simultaneously to adjust  themselves to the work in a team. 
<br>
 The detection system of a station allows to conduct quite independent
 observations and studies for each group participating in the project.
 One can study for example:
<ul><li>

   de-coherence curve (i.e. to repeat the historical experiment of Maze)

</li>
<br><li>
 temperature effect

</li>
<br><li>
   barometric effect

</li>
<br><li>
  angular distributions (zenithal and azimuthal)
     in order to find effective
      acceptance of the station array

</li>
<br><li>
   anisotropy in celestial coordinates (and also Galactic coordinates)

</li>
<br><li>
   shape of energy spectrum around 10<sup><font size=+1>15</font></sup>eV

</li>
<br><li>
   correlations with activity of the Sun, the state of atmosphere, etc.
</li></ul>
<br>
 There are quite a few possibilities and the field for showing off for
everybody  is huge. Permanent contact ("on demand") with researchers 
should
additionally  broaden these possibilities.
<br>
 In course of project development, beside communication via Internet, it 
seems
 important to organize gatherings and meetings of its participants: 
students,
 teachers and researchers. During such meetings, apart from the obvious
exchange   of information, sessions (seminars) should be organized, at 
which
schools would   present their achievements. The sessions could be 
accompanied
by the lectures  on physical topics more or less closely related to the 
Maze
project.  
 Because during the last International Cosmic Ray Conferences projects of
 similar systems have been presented in the form of short communications,
 it is very important to present also the Maze project to the society of
physicists  in a similar way at the next Conference, as soon as the 
project
enters the stage  of realisation. The results of works conducted in the 
frame
of the Maze   project after sufficiently long period of data acquisition 
would
for sure  fulfill the criteria demanded from scientific works published in
refereed  professional literature.

<font size=+1>
<br>
  From over forty years experimental studies of extensive air showers
 have been performed in Lodz. At the beginning the technology of production
 of glass Geiger-Mueller tubes with outer cathode has been elaborated here.
 The first small air shower array has been built of such counters. The results
 obtained on this array allowed the Lodz centre, led then by Aleksander Zawadzki,
 to achieve an important place among the leading groups studying the passage
 of high energy particles through the atmosphere. The Lodz array has been
 then systematically developed and it was always fit both technologically
 and conceptually to the highest world standards. In the course of time
 the registration technique of large area scintillation counters and Conversi
 counters giving very precise measurement of particle densities has been introduced.
 Later the array was enriched with two detectors of the muon component of the showers:
 the ground-level hodoscope covered by a half meter layer of lead and the
 underground hodoscope placed at the depth of 15 m. In order to
 increase the range of distances in studied particle distributions an autonomous
 distant detection point with its own trigger and time registration system
 has been added. From the point of view of the Maze project, the Lodz array
 of those times resembled the system of two detection points planned in the project.
 Obviously, the synchronization of the distant detection point could not be
 realised via GPS, which at those times did not exist at all. In the last important
 step of development the Lodz array has been equipped with a hadron detector
 based on technology of wide spacing spark chambers and semi-calorimetric
 measurement of hadron energy.
  <br>
 Actually the Lodz array undergoes subsequent deep modernization.
 Neutron counters and large area underground muon telescope, which is under
 construction, will be used not only for extensive air shower studies,
 but also for research in the area of Solar physics.
 It is worth noticing, that the Lodz air shower array has been continuously
 working for forty years and rich experiences gathered during whole this
 time make the team of physicists connected to this array fully
 prepared to coordinate and lead the works in frame of the Maze project.</font>

To summarize only one (main scientific) aspect of the Maze project:
the cosmic ray energy spectrum above 10<sup>18</sup>eV, we would like to point 
out
that the collection area of the Maze experiment is comparable to the bigest
existing air shower array AGASA. Some of our solutions (e.g., four 
independent
detectors in each station) make our planned array even better, or at least
different. Results on energy spectrum from our project are expected to be
of similar quality like these of other experiments published nowadays in 
top
physics journals and should enrich the still unsufficient statistic of 
ultra
high energy cosmic ray events. Additionally, the access to raw data and
measurement details gives an excelent opportunity to study important 
physical
problems on much deeper level taht it is possible now with only partially
published data from other groups like, e.g., AGASA. This opens the new wide
area for theoretical interpretation of cosmic ray spectra and giant air 
shower
properties. <br>

The second important aspect for the Maze project is its educational
impact which could be even more important than the scientific one. <br>

The experience gathered for about forty years by the people in Lodz 
laboratory
gives the perspectives that the project shortly described here could be
successfully realised.
