MiniSpectroscopy is best viewed with a monitor that displays more than 256 colors!

<br>
MiniSpectroscopy displays a visual representation (a "spectroscope view") of a sample spectrum simultaneously with a graphical
(intensity vs. wavelength) representation. Students draw or redraw the graph using the computer mouse, and the corresponding
"spectroscope view" appears or changes immediately as they draw, changing just as changes are made in the graph. This immediate
feedback gives students a kinesthetic connection between making the graph and viewing the spectrum being represented.

MiniSpectroscopy is a simplified version of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics full-featured spectroscopy software
called Virtual Spectroscope.

<H3>Virtual Spectroscope</H3>

<P>Virtual Spectroscope is a colorful and easy-to-use software program for teaching about spectra and graphing. <P>

Virtual Spectroscope comes with many different spectra, gases, lamps, astronomical objects,
galaxies, and more.<P>

<P>The software displays a visual representation (a "spectroscope view") of a sample spectrum simultaneously with a graphical (intensity vs. wavelength) representation. Students draw or redraw the graph using the computer mouse, and the corresponding "spectroscope view" appears or changes immediately as they draw, changing just as changes are made in the graph. 
This immediate feedback gives students a kinesthetic connection between making the emission graph and viewing the spectrum being represented. <P>
<P>Another way in which the software can be used is to display a stored spectrum with the graph hidden: students try to draw the corresponding graph, and then compare their version with the original graph. Furthermore, the visual systems of animals, pigment schemes of plants, astronomical objects, and the responses of electronic cameras and sensors can be investigated with data stored on disk, with data taken with the Project STAR Spectrophotometer,* or graphs entered by students. The software will be available for both Mac- and PC-compatible platforms.<P>


<P>*The Project Star Spectrophotometer is currently being sold by Daedalon Corporation of Salem, Massachusetts. <P>
The Spectroscopy materials are available from Science Kit Inc. of Tonawanda New York.<P>
