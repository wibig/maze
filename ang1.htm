Cosmic ray energy spectrum.</center></font></td><td valign="top">

The phenomenon of cosmic radiation is known for 90 years. It was discovered (as
a <I>Hoehenstrahlung</i>) by Viktor Hess and now we knew that
the Earth is constantly bombarded by the high energy particles coming from the
outer space. Cosmic ray studies are recently intensively developed, especially
 in the region of the upper limit of energy spectrum (see Figure beside), where 
 several single cases of particles with energies exceeding 10<sup>20</sup>eV
 (~50 J) have been observed. Such energies are 100 mln times 
 higher than those which can be studied in laboratory experiments
 and most probably higher than those that can ever be achieved in
 experiments built by human hand. Apart from the obvious, but extremely
 compound problem what is going on with matter during collisions
 with such enormous energy release, the question what astrophysical
 mechanisms are at all able to produce particles with such energies
 is also very intriguing.
 If we add to this that the nature of these particles
 is also unknown (they can be protons, compound atomic nuclei, gamma 
quanta,
 neutrinos or even yet undiscovered new particles predicted by theories
 beyond the so called Standard Model), it can not be surprising, that 
 to find answers to at least some of these questions
 just now large ground level arrays are being built (<A
HREF="http://www.auger.org">Auger Observatory</a>)
 and quantitatively completely new satellite experiments
 (<A HREF="http://owl.gsfc.nasa.gov/intro.html">OWL</a>,
<A HREF="http://www.ifcai.pa.cnr.it/Ifcai/airwatch.html">Air Watch</a>,

 of budgets reaching hundreds mln $ are being planned.<br>

 The main difficulty is due to the fact that the flux of particles
 with energies above 10<sup>20</sup>eV is of the order of 1 particle per square 
km
 per century (or even lower), so the detector area has to be sufficiently
 large to obtain required result in reasonable time. The biggest actually 
working 
 experiment <A Href="http://www-akeno.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/AGASA">AGASA</a>
 consists of particle counters spread over an area of 
100km<sup>2</sup>.
 During ~20 years of work it has registered 17 such events 
(as has been claimed at the last cosmic ray conference in Hamburg in 
August this year,
but there are opinions that this number can be overestimated).
 In the projected Auger experiment 1600 detectors will be spread over 10 
times
 bigger area. The main goal of such experiments is to determine (or rather 
estimate)
 in each registered event the energy of the particle which has initiated in 
the
 atmosphere a phenomenon called an extensive air shower, i.e. the cascade 
of
 particles (mainly photons, electrons and muons) with lateral size at the
 observation level measured in kilometers. Such estimation is performed 
basing
 on measurement of particle density in a shower in a few points separated
 by several hundreds meters (1.5 km in the Auger experiment). Moreover, 
measuring
 the times of shower arrival to different detection points one can 
determine
 the direction on the celestial sphere from which the primary particle has 
come.  <br>

 The single detector is essentially a very simple device. It usually 
consists of
 a few scintillation (or Cherenkov) counters connected to the electronic 
system
 with a simple coincidence trigger and converters of time and amplitude of 
signals to 
 digital codes. The essence of large area experiments is a method of 
synchronization
 and communication between detectors and a system of collecting and storing 
the data.
This can be performed by normal optical fibers, like in the AGASA 
experiment,
or by radio, like in the Yakutsk array or in the Auger experiment. 

A non-trivial
problem is also maintaining  stable and reliable performance of the system
(service) and  providing power supply to the detectors separated in total 
by
tens of kilometers. </font>
