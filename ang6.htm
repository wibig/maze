  From over forty years experimental studies of extensive air showers
 have been performed in Lodz. At the beginning the technology of production
 of glass Geiger-Mueller tubes with outer cathode has been elaborated here.
 The first small air shower array has been built of such counters. The results
 obtained on this array allowed the Lodz centre, led then by Aleksander Zawadzki,
 to achieve an important place among the leading groups studying the passage
 of high energy particles through the atmosphere. The Lodz array has been
 then systematically developed and it was always fit both technologically
 and conceptually to the highest world standards. In the course of time
 the registration technique of large area scintillation counters and Conversi
 counters giving very precise measurement of particle densities has been introduced.
 Later the array was enriched with two detectors of the muon component of the showers:
 the ground-level hodoscope covered by a half meter layer of lead and the
 underground hodoscope placed at the depth of 15 m. In order to
 increase the range of distances in studied particle distributions an autonomous
 distant detection point with its own trigger and time registration system
 has been added. From the point of view of the Maze project, the Lodz array
 of those times resembled the system of two detection points planned in the project.
 Obviously, the synchronization of the distant detection point could not be
 realised via GPS, which at those times did not exist at all. In the last important
 step of development the Lodz array has been equipped with a hadron detector
 based on technology of wide spacing spark chambers and semi-calorimetric
 measurement of hadron energy.
  <br>
 Actually the Lodz array undergoes subsequent deep modernization.
 Neutron counters and large area underground muon telescope, which is under
 construction, will be used not only for extensive air shower studies,
 but also for research in the area of Solar physics.
 It is worth noticing, that the Lodz air shower array has been continuously
 working for forty years and rich experiences gathered during whole this
 time make the team of physicists connected to this array fully
 prepared to coordinate and lead the works in frame of the Maze project.
