<P>The intensity of ground level cosmic radiation would be monitored in the number 
of detectors placed on secondary school buildings. Satellite base precise timing 
system would enable to study high energy cosmic ray events. Atmospheric and geomagnetic 
effects will be monitored and studied via short and long term cosmic ray intensity variation 
observed as registration of intensity of highly penetrating and ionising particles. High school 
students would be involved in studies. Data and results would be shared between schools using 
existing computer network.  Information will be exchanged between arrays placed in different 
European towns and countries.</P>

<P>French physicist Prof. Roland Maze discovered (with P.Auger in 1938) extensive air showers, 
and, later, contributed to creation of Cosmic Ray Laboratory in Lodz.</P>

<P> <B><FONT SIZE=+2>Brief description of the idea of detectors</font></P>

</B>

<P>Secondary (high level) schools in the local area will be equipped with cosmic ray detectors.</P>



<B><P>One mini array unit:</P>

</B><P>We propose the array of 4 scintillation detectors of the area of 1m<SUP><font size=+0>2</font> </SUP>each. Detectors will be installed on the school roofs at the corners of square and separated by about 10-30m. The light from the counter will be collected by one photo-multiplier per detector and the signal will be digitalized at the local on-line control system. The system will be equipped with the accurate absolute time clock (with relative accuracy at the local area near to 10 nanosecond) corrected by the satellite positioning system (probably GPS at the beginning).</P>



<B><P>Method of data collection:</P>

</B><P>The detector would be working permanently. It would require human activity for data transmission only (in the case of correct work). The on-line system can accumulate data for a time of the order of 5 weeks without data transmission.  </P>

<P> </P>

<B><P>Communication between mini arrays:</P>

</B><P>All mini arrays from the local area will transmit the data off-line using urban internet lines to one central system. The data would be accessible at the mini array level. However the standard access would be provided from the central system via internet connection. Every participant would have access to the central system data.</P>



<P> <B>Methods of data processing:</P>

</B><P>Any participant could use his software or use available software created by other co-participants. Generally PC-based Linux with C++ (probably CERN's ROOT subroutines) will be preferred (open systems are generally more creative oriented). Results would be available on the individual (personal, school) web pages. Scientifically important results would be present also on the local official web page.</P>



<B><P>Brief description of expected events and related targets:</P>



<UL>

</B><LI>At the separate detector level (4 separate pieces of information per mini array) the secondary cosmic ray particle flux can be constantly measured. The intensity is about 170 counts per second for 1m<SUP><font size=+0>2</font></SUP> detector (corresponding to 6 penetrating and ionising particles passing per second per human head or 1 particle per hand).</LI></UL>





<UL>



<UL>

<LI>The intensity is atmospheric pressure dependent (see physical background) which gives a few percent variations (can be easily corrected).</LI>

<LI>geomagnetic disturbances can be seen as 2-4 percent variation, most of these follow solar activity and coronal mass emission towards the Earth, and have bad influence on the radio wave transmission, satellite behaviour etc.</LI>

<LI>small (however short time) variation would reflect high altitude atmospheric temperature changing,</LI>

<LI>thunderstorms and other atmospheric violent effects can alter cosmic ray muons counting rate via the change of the Earth electric field (poorly known effects, seen already in a few experiments sometimes as disturbance, e.g. L3+Cosmics at CERN),</LI>

<LI>long term variation due to 11 year solar cycle, probably correlated with global Earth weather changing,</LI>

<LI>test of apparatus (similar behaviour of all detectors),</LI>

<LI>educational example of the mathematical fluctuations and statistical distributions</LI></UL>

</UL>

<DIR>



<P>Data will be accumulated from all local mini arrays strengthening the effects.</P></DIR>





<UL>

<LI>At the separate mini array level (4 detectors) the showers of secondary particles (mainly electromagnetic: photons, electrons and positrons) will be detected with the rate about 1 per minute. Precise measurements of time difference between pulses from 4 detectors (with accuracy of the order of 1 nanosecond) would enable one to determine the direction of the primary very energetic cosmic ray particle. The amplitudes (digitalized) of signals provide information about energy of the primary cosmic ray particle.</LI></UL>





<UL>



<UL>

<LI>such events have energies above 10<SUP><font size=+0>15</font></SUP> eV, very important energy region to study the origin of cosmic rays,</LI>

<LI>theoretical problem of methods of accelerating particles in nature (as the most powerful human made accelerators cannot yet get energies of 10<SUP><font size=+0>13</font></SUP>eV),</LI>

<LI>small number statistics problems can be learned practically.</LI></UL>

</UL>





<UL>

<LI>The off-line correlation of arriving time from events registered at the local area would enable one to find events passing through many mini arrays within the same 400 nanoseconds. The precise (about 10 nanoseconds) absolute time records give opportunity to determine the direction of primary particle. The energy of primary particle in such events typically exceeds 10<SUP><font size=+0>18</font></SUP>eV. For mini arrays covering area of 100 km<SUP><font size=+0>2</font></SUP> (10km x 10km) it would happen about once a day (400 per year). </LI></UL>





<UL>



<UL>

<LI>a cluster of about 30 mini arrays has an area comparable with the largest existing detectors for highest energy cosmic rays, therefore quite a few such clusters would provide scientific results of the highest value,</LI>

<LI>Achievement, monitoring and using the time system providing absolute time accuracy of 10 nanoseconds (3 meters in space) is very important for future navigation systems.</LI></UL>

<B><P>Technical details of mini-arrays</P>

</B>

<P>The estimated material cost of one mini array (one school) is about EUR 5.000,-.
<br>

This include 42 kg of polystyrene based scintillator (MINOS experiment type) 4
photomultipliers (small diameter), re-emitting fibres, GPS receiver and antenna,
PC elements for on-line systems, housings, covers, cables and electronics (most
costly are scintillator and phototubes).<br>

The single 1m<SUP><font size=+0>2</font></SUP> scintillation counter would be made of 1cm thick
polystyrene base scintillation material. Via re-emitting fibres the light is
transmitted to photomultiplier (one per 1m<SUP><font size=+0>2</font></SUP> counter). Signals are
transmitted to the on line computer. For signals arriving simultaneously (20
nanoseconds) from min. 2 counters the accurate time is recorded together with
the signal amplitude information. The counting rate of the individual 1m<SUP><font size=+0>2</font></SUP>
detector is recorded every 5 minutes. </P>



<P>The system collects the data permanently. It gains about 150kB per hour or 3.5 MB per day.</P>

<P>Cosmic rays permanently bombard Earth coming mostly from outside the Solar System.
Solar wind can influence penetration of the inner part of the Solar System (where we are)
for relatively low energy cosmic ray particles. Therefore their fluxes at the Earth vicinity depend on the solar activity.

<br>

Most of cosmic rays are charged, ionised and stable particle (including nuclei). To get
to the top of atmosphere the have to go across the Earth magnetic field, which pushes away
low energy particles (so called geomagnetic cut-off, it is latitude dependent). Therefore
disturbance of the Earth magnetic field alter the ground level cosmic ray intensity registration.
<br>

We are sheltered from cosmic ray bombarding by the atmosphere. Energetic particles interact with
nuclei of atmosphere and produce secondaries or even cascades of secondary particles. Results of
these processes can be observed as the secondary cosmic
rays at the ground level. The observer altitude and the state of the high altitude atmosphere is
very important for observed events. Some secondary particles can decay in the low-density high
altitude atmosphere to highly penetrating and ionising particles called muons. These form the
main contribution to natural radioactivity due to cosmic rays. Approximately 6 muons
are passing through our heads every second. Very high energy cosmic ray particles
produce cascades of secondaries which can reach the ground level. The cascades
consist mainly of electromagnetic component (photons, electrons and positrons - anti-electrons).
Their densities can exceed locally thousands per meter squared (per event). </P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+2><P>Some historical background for cosmic rays</B></FONT> </P>



<P>The phenomenon of cosmic radiation is known for 90 years. It was discovered (as a Hoehenstrahlung)
by German physicist Victor Hess (Nobel Prize in 1936) and now we know that the Earth is constantly
bombarded by the high energy particles coming from the outer space. High-energy particles form in
the atmosphere so-called Extensive Air Showers (EAS) which were discovered by Roland Maze and Pierre Auger in 1938.
<br>

The first EAS array was built by Maze on the roof of &#200;cole Normale Sup&#232;rieure in Paris.
<br>
At the beginning of the fifties, Roland Maze closely collaborated with A. Zawadzki and
other Polish  physicists creating the comic ray laboratory in Lodz.
<br>

Cosmic ray studies are recently intensively developed, especially in
the region of the upper limit of energy spectrum, where several single
cases of particles with energies exceeding 10<SUP><font size=+0>20</font></SUP>eV (about 50 J)
have been observed.</P>
